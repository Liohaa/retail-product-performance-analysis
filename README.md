# Retail Product Performance Analysis
A data analysis project using Python and SQL that analyzes retail sales data to identify top- and underperforming products, calculate profits and losses, and compare sales with and without discounts.

## Goals

This project helps to better understand key aspects of retail product performance, such as:

- Sales and demand – total sales volume (in units and weight), revenue, and sales trends over time  
- Returns – number of returned items and which products have the most returns  
- Discounts – impact of discounts on sales volume, revenue, and profit margins  
- Profitability – gross profit and product-level margins  
- Losses – estimate of money lost because products are spoiled or returned
- Category performance – identification of top- and underperforming product categories  
- Sales dynamics – time-based analysis of key performance indicators
