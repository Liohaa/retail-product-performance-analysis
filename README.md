# Retail Product Performance Analysis
A data analysis project using Python and SQL that analyzes retail sales data to identify top- and underperforming products, calculate profits and losses, and compare sales with and without discounts.

## Goals

This project helps to better understand key aspects of retail product performance, such as:

- Sales and demand – total sales volume, revenue, and trends over time  
- Product performance – which items are top/underperforming  
- Discounts – how discounts impact sales and profit  
- Returns – how many items are returned and which products are most affected  
- Losses – estimation of product losses due to spoilage  
- Profitability – gross profit and margins for each product
