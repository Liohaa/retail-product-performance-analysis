## Cleaned Data

This folder contains cleaned datasets that were used in the analysis and visualizations for this project.

The original data comes from the public Kaggle dataset:

**Supermarket Sales Data**  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yapwh1208/supermarket-sales-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yapwh1208/supermarket-sales-data)

All data is synthetic and provided for educational use only.

Steps included:

- Checking for and confirming the absence of duplicates and missing values
- Renaming columns for clarity

- `cleaned_loss_rates.csv`: Loss rate data  

### Tools Used
